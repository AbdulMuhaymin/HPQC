# Procedure for cropping photos for people.html
================================================

If anything doesn't seem easy, or seems to look different from what's described below, please let an admin know:

1) https://www.img2go.com/crop-image (drag and drop your photo into the box)
2) Make the box have dimensions: Width=270, Height=285 (you might have to zoom out to see the boxes where you can type custom values).
3) Drag the cropping window by a corner (rather than a side), to preserve the aspect ratio.
4) Select the desired area (include the full face and full hair, but not much more)
5) Click "Apply"
6) Click "Save As"
7) Set "Target Format" to "PNG"
8) Set "Filename" to be FirstnameLastName.PNG. If the original image was a PNG, then use JPG. This way the original image and the cropped image have the same name, and just a different extension
9) Don't forget to make sure "Quality" is set to 100%
10) Set "DPI" to 3000 (this presumably sets it to the maximum DPI, which seems to be 1200 at the time of writing this).
11) Click "Save"
12) Upload the new saved (and cropped) photo to the images folder.
