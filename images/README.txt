Procedure for cropping photos for people.html

1) https://www.img2go.com/
2) Make Width=270, Height=285
3) Drag the cropping window by a corner, to preserve te aspect ratio.
4) Select the desired area (include the full face and full hair, but not much more)
5) Click "Apply"
6) Click "Save As"
7) Set "Target Format" to "PNG"
8) Set "Filename" to be FirstnameLastName.PNG. If the original image was a PNG, then use JPG. This way the original image and the cropped image have the same name, and just a different extension
9) Don't forget to make sure "Quality" is set to 100%
10) Set "DPI" to 3000 (this presumably sets it to the maximum DPI, which seems to be 1200 at the time of writing this).
11) Click "Save"
12) Upload the new saved (and cropped) photo to the images folder.
